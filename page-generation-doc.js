/* This is not code. It is laid out like code to show the logistical source for each of the several page "types" 
    we generate using a number of approaches offered by Gatsby. These grew organically as we learned Gatsby's 
    various approaches to page building and developed marketing ideas.

    That said, I find this confusing and it would probably benefit from a different approach such as moving 
    page generation currently done using {MarkdownRemark.frontmatter__slug}.js and {MarkdownRemark.frontmatter__hhc_slug}.js
    into gatsby-node.js along with other types of pages creation.
