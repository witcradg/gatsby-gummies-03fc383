							The cannabis industry is arguably one of the fastest evolving industries today along with
							the organic food industry. While new cannabinoids are being actively studied, isolated, and
							used to produce edible products, such as delta-8 gummies aka weed gummies, some are better
							than others. Also, many people now understand that other than THC, perhaps there is no other
							cannabinoid that can get you high (or as high). That is one of the reasons why the demand
							for weed gummies is on the rise in our experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							Weed gummies are a perfectly legal cannabinoid product that will naturally help you relax;
							it works by assisting the body with getting rid of stress and dealing with inflammation or
							pain. Yes, there is a mild euphoric experience associated with its use, but nothing like
							smoking weed or any other drug.
						</p>
						<p>
							Delta-8 THC edibles are some of the most popular cannabis products, and many products like
							gummies are infused with them. In this article, we’ll take a look at all the weed gummy
							edibles you can buy online. We’ll also go briefly into why they are an excellent choice.

							<strong>The Best HHC Gummies </strong>
						</h2>
						<p>
							Now, before we go ahead and start listing the best HHC gummies, it is important to
							understand that they will give you a mellow high. However, most people report enjoying it.
							If anything, these are excellent products manufactured with the highest standard, quality
							control procedures. That’s why these are the best weed gummies you can buy online today.
						</p>
						<h3>HHC Gummie Bears 1000MG</h3>
						<p>
							Now many people who have no idea what to expect from consuming Industrial Hemp gummies will start with
							our Gummie Bears. One of the reasons is that it has only 40 pieces of gummies is a great way
							to give the product a shot. However, it is infused with 1000MG of Delta-8 THC. What that
							means is that you get to give it a shot without committing to a larger batch.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, many people also prefer our Sour Worms because of the slightly sour after taste,
							which is blue dream berry for those who are familiar with it. It is this sweet and sour
							taste that lingers on your tongue for quite a while after you have consumed it. Also, our
							Gummie Bears smell great.

						<h3>What does HHC feel like?</h3>
						<p>
What Does HHC Feel Like? HHC's effects are very similar to those of THC, such as feelings of euphoria, 
increased heart rate, and body temperature, as well as altered visual and auditory perceptions. Some HHC 
users describe its effects as more relaxing than stimulating, similar to delta 8.
</p>
<h3>Will HHC gummies make me high?</h3>
<p>
Yes, HHC does get you high. And just like THC, that high feeling is going to affect everyone differently. 
The high lasts about two to three hours depending on a few factors. These factors include how much is taken, 
how the body processes HHC, and how often HHC is used along with other products.

</p>
<h3>How long does it take for HHC edibles to kick in?</h3>
					<p>	


HHC gummies are the most popular form of edibles, and effects take about 30-45 minutes to fully kick-in. 
Similar to Delta 8 or Delta 9, the effects felt from edibles tend to last much longer than a vape product.
</p>
<h3>How potent is HHC?</h3>
					<p>	

This makes HHC more stable than THC long-term and alters its ability to bind with various receptors in the body, 
Overall, HHC is considered about 80% as potent as THC (some suggest it's stronger) but otherwise shares virtually 
identical traits.
</p>
<h3>Is HHC legal?</h3>
					<p>	
HHC-O is fully federally legal and legal 38 states, while Delta 9-THC is federally illegal and illegal in most states. 
Both HHC and Delta 9-THC produce euphoric psychoactive effects on users and carry a wide variety of medical and 
recreational benefits.
</p>
<h3>Does HHC show up in drug test?</h3>
					<p>	

HHC might not show up on drug tests. However, our evidence is all anecdotal and not scientifically proven to 
evade drug tests. Many believe that HHC doesn't convert into 11-hydroxy-THC, a metabolite of THC flagged in 
drug tests for marijuana. Just keep in mind, that's not hard evidence.
</p>
<h3>Is HHC better than Delta 8?</h3>
					<p>	

HHC produces very similar effects to Delta 9 THC, but as marijuana remains federally illegal, those who can't 
legally buy psychoactive cannabis plants opt for hemp derivatives. HHC is stronger than Delta 8 THC but less 
psychoactive than THC-O.
</p>
<h3>How is HHC created?</h3>
					<p>	

HHC was first created in 1944 by the American chemist Roger Adams, when he added hydrogen molecules to Delta-9 THC. 
This process, known as hydrogenation, converts THC to hexahydrocannabinol (HHC). Hydrogenation isn't limited to cannabinoid 
production. A similar process is used to convert vegetable oil to margarine.
