					This Delta 8 THC may affect blood pressure, heart rate, and/or intraocular pressure in some people.

				<h6 className={styles.description_title}>Heat Issues</h6>
				<p>
					Delta 8 gummies don’t always do well in hot climates. If your delta 8 gummies have melted into a
					(delicious) singular gummy blob, a quick remedy is to place them in the freezer for up to 1 hour.
					Once frozen, open the bag at the sides and cut into equal pieces. Precise dosing requires a gram
					scale.
				</p>
				<p>Take gummies with food or eat within 10-30 minutes after taking them for best effects.</p>
                <br />
				<h6 className={styles.description_title}>Smell When Opening the Bag</h6>
				<p>
					Don’t worry, your delta 8 gummies are fine! This is due to the oxygen pack doing its thing within
					the bag. Your gummies shouldn’t absorb any of that flavor, just let the bag sit open for a bit and
					it’ll go away soon enough. You can remove the oxygen pack as well if you’d like.
				</p>
